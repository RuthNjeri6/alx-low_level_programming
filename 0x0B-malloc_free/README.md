# Automatic and Dynamic Memory
Whenyou declare a variable or put a string in double qoutes, memory is allocated automatically.  
There is need to allocate memory manually. This is called dynamic Allocation. Done when you dont know how much mempry to allocate in advance and only in runtime after compilation.  
To allocate memory dynamically we use ```malloc``` and ```free``` functions
