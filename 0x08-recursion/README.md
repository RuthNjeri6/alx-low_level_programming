This directory contains various recursive functions that are implemeted to solve task.   
Recursion is used when we want to iterate something or do something repeatedly.   
For a recursive function we have to have a way to ternimate the repeated way of doing something otherwise it will just go into an infinite loop. This is also called a base case.
