# Pointers
Pointers are variables whose values is addresses of other variables.

# Arrays
Arrays are group of variables occupying a contigous memory space. In C the the variables in the array are of the same type.
```c
int arr[5] = {0,1,2,3,4};
```

# Strings
A string is a one-dimensional array where the variables are of type char.
```c
char str[] = "Hello";
```

In this project we will look at pointers, arrays and strings. The tasks covered in this project include:
* Creating a function that takes a pointer to an integer as paramenter and updates the value it points to.
* Creating a function that swaps the values of two integers.
* Creating a function that returns the length of a string.
* Creating a function that prints a string to **stdio**
* Creating a function that prints a string in reverse.
* creating a function that reverses a string.
* Creating a function that prints every character of a string starting from the 1st one.
* Creating a function that prints half of the string.
* Creating a function that prints **n** elements of an array of integers.
* Creating a function that copies the string pointed to by ```src``` to the buffer pointed to by ```dest```.
